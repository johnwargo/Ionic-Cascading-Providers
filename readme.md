Ionic Cascading Providers
=========================

I was working on an Ionic 2 project where the app needed to be able to be configured with different data access mechanisms. To prove one way to implement this, I created this project. It exposes a single Ionic provider that abstracts away two other providers. It works, so this is something I can use for my project.
